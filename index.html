                    <p>Sascha Biesi and Yauss Berenji didn't set out to start a punk rock cupcake business with Skull & Cakebones, but that's exactly what they've grown, baking professionally and cultivating meaningful relationships with other local small businesses. Biesi, had long since nailed down the particulars of vegan baking after her daughter Ruby, now 12, was born with a dairy allergy. Berenji's mother, a health nut descended from a long line of diabetics, was so impressed with Biesi's creative flavor combinations that she encouraged the couple to pursue the hobby as a business.</p>
