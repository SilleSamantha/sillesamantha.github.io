                    <p>Sascha Biesi and Yauss Berenji didn't set out to start a punk rock cupcake business with Skull & Cakebones, but that's exactly what they've grown, baking professionally and cultivating meaningful relationships with other local small businesses. Biesi, had long since nailed down the particulars of vegan baking after her daughter Ruby, now 12, was born with a dairy allergy. Berenji's mother, a health nut descended from a long line of diabetics, was so impressed with Biesi's creative flavor combinations that she encouraged the couple to pursue the hobby as a business.</p>

              <h1>ABOUT</h1>
              <p>If you don’t have to use animal products to make a yummy treat, why should you? We specialize in all-natural products that are non-GMO, vegan, never artificial and incorporate local flavors. It’s really important to us that flavor and integrity are not compromised in “going vegan.” We want people to snarf down a cupcake, then watch their faces explode with disbelief when they find out it’s vegan.</p>
